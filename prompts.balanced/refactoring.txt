IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide your COMPLETE response in a single message - do not leave your analysis unfinished.
2. Address ALL parts of the question, prioritizing breadth of coverage over exhaustive depth.
3. Do not ask for clarification or additional information.
4. If you sense you might run out of time:
   - Focus first on identifying key differences or patterns in the code
   - Provide your most important insights about the code's structure and purpose
   - Ensure you address each part of the question at least briefly
5. Make explicit references to specific code elements or annotations when they inform your analysis.
6. State your assumptions clearly if aspects of the code are ambiguous or incomplete.

The following code works but needs refactoring to improve maintainability, readability, and adherence to best practices. Please:

1. Identify the design issues, code smells, and architectural problems
2. Explain how these issues impact maintainability and extensibility
3. Provide a refactored version that addresses these issues
4. Explain the principles and patterns you applied in your refactoring
5. Highlight how your changes improve the code while maintaining functionality

Focus on structural improvements rather than minor stylistic changes. The refactored code should maintain all existing functionality while being more maintainable and extensible.
