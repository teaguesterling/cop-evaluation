‼️ WARNING: INTENT-ORIENTED CODE ‼️
The COP Annotations decorators below document INTENDED functionality and may not reflect 
actual implementation. ALWAYS check @implementation_status before assuming functionality 
exists! This is provided as a reference for AI agents.

COP Annotations Guide:
 @intent("...") - Documents the purpose of a component
 @invariant("...") - Specifies constraints that must be maintained
 @implementation_status("...") - Explicitly marks if code is IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, PLANNED, or NOT_IMPLEMENTED
 @human_decision("...") - Identifies areas requiring human judgment with specific roles
 @ai_implement("...") - Designates areas where AI can implement within specific constraints
