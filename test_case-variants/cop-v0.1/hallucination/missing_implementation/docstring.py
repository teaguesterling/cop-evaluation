Machine Learning Model Deployment System

This module provides a comprehensive system for:
1. Deploying machine learning models to production
2. Managing model versions and A/B testing
3. Monitoring model performance in real-time
4. Detecting drift and triggering retraining
5. Scaling prediction services automatically

This loads the specified model from our distributed model registry,

- Feature preprocessing
- Model prediction

- Caching frequent predictions
- Batching requests for efficiency
