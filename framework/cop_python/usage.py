üö® GUIDANCE FOR WRITING COP-ANNOTATED CODE üö®

=====================================================================
| This guide helps you WRITE code with COP annotations effectively. |

WRITING EFFECTIVE COP ANNOTATIONS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
üí° Annotations create bidirectional communication between humans and AI üí°

CORE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:

1Ô∏è‚É£ ALWAYS mark implementation status
   @implementation_status(IMPLEMENTED)  # Complete functionality
   @implementation_status(PARTIAL, details="Only supports X")  # Be specific!
   @implementation_status(NOT_IMPLEMENTED)  # Include NotImplementedError

2Ô∏è‚É£ HIGHLIGHT security concerns
   @risk("SQL injection possible", severity="HIGH")  # Mark vulnerabilities
   @invariant("Inputs must be sanitized", critical=True)  # Mark requirements

3Ô∏è‚É£ DOCUMENT decisions and rationale
   @decision(rationale="Chose X because...")  # Explain reasoning
   @decision(implementor="human", reason="...")  # Mark human-only code
   @decision(implementor="ai", constraints=["..."])  # Provide guidance

4Ô∏è‚É£ CLARIFY intent
   @intent("Process payments securely")  # Express purpose clearly

PARAMETER REFERENCE:

@implementation_status(status, details=None, alternative=None)
  ‚Ä¢ status: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, BUGGY, PLANNED, NOT_IMPLEMENTED, UNKNOWN, DEPRECATED
  ‚Ä¢ details: Optionally, explain limitations or partial implementation
  ‚Ä¢ alternative: For DEPRECATED, what to use instead

@risk(description, category="security", severity="MEDIUM", impact=None, mitigation=None)
  ‚Ä¢ description: What the risk is
  ‚Ä¢ category: The risk categury: ("security", "performance", etc.)
  ‚Ä¢ severity: "LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH", "CRITICAL"
  ‚Ä¢ impact: An optional assessement of the impact of the risk if not addressed
  ‚Ä¢ mitigation: An optional list of any mitigation strategies that *have been* taken

@invariant(condition, critical=False, scope="always")
  ‚Ä¢ condition: What must always be true
  ‚Ä¢ critical: Whether essential for security/correctness
  ‚Ä¢ scope: What's the scope of this invariant (should be ommitted if "always")

@decision(description=None, implementor=None, constraints=None, rationale=None, 
         options=None, answer=None, decider=None, **kwargs)
(All arguments here are optional and should only be included if explicitly relevant)
  ‚Ä¢ description: Decision question/description
  ‚Ä¢ implementor: Who should implement ("human", "ai", etc.)
  ‚Ä¢ constraints: Requirements for implementation
  ‚Ä¢ rationale: Why this decision was made
  ‚Ä¢ options: Considered alternatives
  ‚Ä¢ answer: The selected option
  ‚Ä¢ decider: Who made the decision
  ‚Ä¢ **kwargs: Other annotations are captured and preserved

@intent(description)
  ‚Ä¢ description: Purpose of the component

TESTING ANNOTATIONS:
Tests complete the truth triangle by verifying that implementation matches intent.
- Write tests that explicitly verify @invariant conditions
- Ensure @risk annotations have matching security tests
- Use test results to validate @implementation_status claims
- Remember: Untested invariants are just aspirations

THE DECISION TETRAHEDRON:
COP connects four dimensions of software understanding:
- Intent: What we want to accomplish
- Implementation: What actually exists in code
- Tests: Verification that code works correctly
- Decisions: Why we chose specific approaches
  
Capturing decisions creates a complete picture that preserves
knowledge that would otherwise be lost over time.

ANNOTATION BALANCE:
"Less is more" - Focus on quality over quantity
- ALWAYS include implementation status
- Add security risks and critical invariants
- Document important decisions, not trivial ones
- Limit to 3-4 annotations per component
- Annotate public interfaces more thoroughly than internals

EXAMPLE: EFFECTIVE ANNOTATION PATTERNS

# Security-critical component
@intent("Authenticate users securely")
@implementation_status(IMPLEMENTED)
@risk("Credential exposure", severity="HIGH")
@invariant("Passwords never stored in plaintext", critical=True)
@decision("Use bcrypt for hashing", rationale="Industry standard with work factor")
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Implementation...

# AI-implementable component
@intent("Validate email format")
@implementation_status(NOT_IMPLEMENTED)
@decision(
    implementor="ai",
    constraints=["RFC 5322 compliant", "Handle Unicode domains"]
)
def validate_email(email):
    # Implementation needed

# Component with known limitations
@intent("Process payment transactions")
@implementation_status(PARTIAL, details="Credit cards only, no cryptocurrency")
@risk("PCI compliance required", severity="HIGH")
@invariant("Transactions must be atomic", critical=True)
def process_payment(payment_info):
    # Implementation...
