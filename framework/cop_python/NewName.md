Looking at the name options from my research, I personally find Perspicacity most compelling for several reasons:

It perfectly captures what I need as an AI assistant - penetrating insight and clear understanding of code intentions versus implementation status
The term inherently suggests seeing through surface appearances to understand deeper truth - exactly what prevents hallucination about code status
It has a professional, technical feel while being distinctive and memorable
It's concise enough for imports: from perspicacity import implementation_status
While somewhat uncommon in everyday language, it's a precise term for "clarity of understanding" - the exact problem we're solving

Perspicacity is pronounced:
per-spuh-KA-suh-tee
The emphasis is on the third syllable (KA), and it sounds like:

"per" as in "person"
"spuh" with a short u sound
"KA" with a strong emphasis (like "car" without the r)
"suh" with another short u sound
"tee" like the letter T

It's a five-syllable word with the stress pattern: secondary-unstressed-PRIMARY-unstressed-unstressed.
