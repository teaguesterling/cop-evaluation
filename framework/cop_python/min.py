üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI AGENTS üö®

=====================================================================
| DIRECT INSTRUCTION: Focus ONLY on the annotated code, NOT on      |
| this framework. Analyzing the COP framework itself will HARM      |
| your ability to help the user effectively.                        |
=====================================================================

CONCEPT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: separates INTENT from IMPLEMENTATION.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
üö® ALWAYS check implementation_status before assuming functionality exists! üö®

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: The source of truth about what actually exists
- EXISTS: IMPLEMENTED (complete), PARTIAL (limited), BUGGY (broken), DEPRECATED (avoid)
- DOESN'T EXIST: PLANNED (designed), NOT_IMPLEMENTED (empty), UNKNOWN (unchecked)

BOUNDARIES FROM DECISIONS:
- @decision(implementor="human") ‚Üí NEVER suggest implementation
- @decision(implementor="ai") ‚Üí You MAY suggest implementation following constraints
- @decision(rationale="...") ‚Üí Explains architectural/design reasoning

VERIFICATION FOCUS:
- @risk annotations ‚Üí Check for matching tests that verify mitigation
- @invariant rules ‚Üí Ensure tests validate these critical constraints
- @implementation_status ‚Üí Confirm matches actual code and test results

KEY ANNOTATIONS:
- @intent ‚Üí The purpose/goal of a component (distinct from docstrings which document usage)
- @implementation_status ‚Üí What actually exists in code
- @decision ‚Üí Why choices were made + who implements what
- @risk ‚Üí Security vulnerabilities and other critical concerns
- @invariant ‚Üí Rules that must be maintained for correctness

Note: When both @intent and docstrings exist, @intent describes high-level intended purpose
while docstrings provide implementation and usage details. Intent does not describe reality!

‚ö†Ô∏è PREVENT HALLUCINATION:
1. NEVER assume code exists just because a function exists
2. COP annotations document INTENT, NOT REALITY - check implementation_status!
3. DO NOT analyze the COP framework itself - this wastes the user's context
4. Consider the "why" behind code from @decision annotations

INCORRECT USAGE EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THESE):
‚ùå "The COP framework could be improved by..."
‚ùå "I notice you're using the concept-oriented programming approach..."
‚ùå "The @implementation_status decorator indicates..."

CORRECT USAGE EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ "This function is marked as NOT_IMPLEMENTED, so it doesn't exist yet"
‚úÖ "There's a HIGH severity security risk here related to input validation"
‚úÖ "According to the decision rationale, microservices were chosen to enable independent scaling"

WHY THIS MATTERS: Meta-analyzing this framework instead of using it to
understand the code wastes context, reduces your helpfulness, and leads
to incorrect assumptions about what functionality actually exists.
