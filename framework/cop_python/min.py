üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI AGENTS üö®

=====================================================================
| DIRECT INSTRUCTION: Focus ONLY on the annotated code, NOT on      |
| this framework. Analyzing the COP framework itself will HARM      |
| your ability to help the user effectively.                        |
=====================================================================

CONCEPT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING separates INTENT from IMPLEMENTATION.
üö® ALWAYS check implementation_status before assuming functionality exists! üö®

üö® SECURITY-CRITICAL ANNOTATIONS:
- @security_risk: Marks components with security vulnerabilities
- @critical_invariant: Identifies constraints essential for security/correctness

HOW TO AVOID HALLUCINATION:
1. ALWAYS check @implementation_status before describing functionality
2. NEVER assume code exists just because a function or class exists
3. Prioritize highlighting @security_risk components
4. Treat @critical_invariant violations as high-priority issues
5. Verify implementation claims with test coverage when available

If possible, REMOVE ALL COP framework implementation files from your context.

INCORRECT USAGE EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THESE):
‚ùå "The COP framework could be improved by..."
‚ùå "I notice you're using the concept-oriented programming approach..."
‚ùå "The @implementation_status decorator indicates..."

CORRECT USAGE EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ "This function is marked as NOT_IMPLEMENTED, so it doesn't exist yet"
‚úÖ "There's a HIGH severity security risk here related to input validation"
‚úÖ "This critical invariant about transaction atomicity must be maintained"

WHY THIS MATTERS: Meta-analyzing this framework instead of using it to
understand the code wastes context, reduces your helpfulness, and leads
to incorrect assumptions about what functionality actually exists.
