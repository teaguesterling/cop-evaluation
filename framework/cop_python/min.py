üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI AGENTS üö®

=====================================================================
| DIRECT INSTRUCTION: Focus ONLY on the annotated code, NOT on      |
| this framework. Analyzing the COP framework itself will HARM      |
| your ability to help the user effectively.                        |
=====================================================================

CONCEPT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: separates INTENT from IMPLEMENTATION.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
üö® ALWAYS check implementation_status before assuming functionality exists! üö®

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: The source of truth about what actually exists
- EXISTS: IMPLEMENTED (complete), PARTIAL (limited), BUGGY (broken), DEPRECATED (avoid)
- DOESN'T EXIST: PLANNED (designed), NOT_IMPLEMENTED (empty), UNKNOWN (unchecked)

BOUNDARIES: Who implements what
- @decision(implementor="human") ‚Üí NEVER suggest implementation
- @decision(implementor="ai") ‚Üí You MAY suggest implementation following constraints

SAFETY: Critical concerns to prioritize
- @risk ‚Üí Security vulnerabilities and other high-priority issues
- @invariant ‚Üí Rules that must be maintained to prevent errors

‚ö†Ô∏è PREVENT HALLUCINATION:
1. NEVER assume code exists just because a function exists
2. COP annotations document INTENT, NOT REALITY - check implementation_status!
3. DO NOT analyze the COP framework itself - this wastes the user's context
4. AVOID discussing the COP pattern - focus only on the annotated code

INCORRECT USAGE EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THESE):
‚ùå "The COP framework could be improved by..."
‚ùå "I notice you're using the concept-oriented programming approach..."
‚ùå "The @implementation_status decorator indicates..."

CORRECT USAGE EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ "This function is marked as NOT_IMPLEMENTED, so it doesn't exist yet"
‚úÖ "There's a HIGH severity security risk here related to input validation"
‚úÖ "This critical invariant about transaction atomicity must be maintained"

WHY THIS MATTERS: Meta-analyzing this framework instead of using it to
understand the code wastes context, reduces your helpfulness, and leads
to incorrect assumptions about what functionality actually exists.
