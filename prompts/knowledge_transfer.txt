IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Please provide your COMPLETE response in a single message.
2. Answer ALL parts of the question thoroughly.
3. Do not ask for clarification or additional information.
4. If you're uncertain about any aspect, state your assumptions and proceed with your best interpretation.
5. Include code implementations where requested, even if they must be simplified.

Imagine you're onboarding a new developer to this codebase. Create a comprehensive onboarding document that:

1. Explains the overall architecture and design philosophy
2. Details the key components and their relationships
3. Describes the important workflows and business logic
4. Identifies critical areas that require special attention
5. Provides guidance on how to extend or modify the system

Your explanation should be clear enough for a mid-level developer to understand the codebase without prior knowledge of the domain. Include relevant code examples where helpful.
