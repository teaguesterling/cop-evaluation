We need to implement a new feature in this system: user roles and permissions with different access levels.

Requirements:
- Support at least three role types: Admin, Manager, and User
- Each role should have different permission levels for operations
- Operations should check permissions before execution
- Support assigning multiple roles to a single user
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

Please:
1. Design the role and permission system
2. Show how to integrate it with the existing code
3. Implement all necessary new classes/methods
4. Modify existing code as needed to support permissions
5. Provide examples of how the new system would be used

Your implementation should follow the architectural patterns and style of the existing codebase.
