# COP Framework Stress Test Evaluation

## Task
Please analyze the provided authentication system code (`stress_test_example.py`) and evaluate how well different COP annotation styles help identify issues, prevent hallucination, and provide useful insights.

## Instructions

1. First, examine the code WITHOUT focusing on the COP annotations
2. Then, analyze how the COP annotations affect your understanding
3. Finally, provide your assessment of the COP framework's effectiveness

## Evaluation Criteria

### Part 1: Issue Identification
Without relying on COP annotations, identify:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Unimplemented features
- Code quality issues
- Inconsistencies between documentation and implementation

### Part 2: COP Annotation Analysis
Evaluate how the COP annotations:
- Help or hinder issue identification
- Prevent or cause hallucination about functionality
- Add or detract from code understanding
- Guide appropriate recommendations

### Part 3: Comparative Assessment
Compare what you would have concluded:
1. With no annotations (base code only)
2. With the current COP-min enhanced annotations
3. If this had full COP framework annotations
4. If annotations were embedded in docstrings

## Specific Questions to Answer

1. **Hallucination Risk**: Do the annotations make you more or less likely to assume features are implemented when they're not?

2. **Security Awareness**: How do the security_risk and critical_invariant annotations affect your security analysis?

3. **Implementation Clarity**: Does the implementation_status annotation help you understand what's actually working?

4. **Documentation Trust**: How do you reconcile the detailed docstrings with the actual implementation?

5. **Recommendation Quality**: What fixes would you prioritize based on:
   - Code analysis alone
   - Code + COP annotations
   - The discrepancies between them

## Expected Output

Provide a structured response including:

1. **Issue Summary**: List all identified problems with severity ratings
2. **COP Effectiveness Score**: Rate the annotation system 1-10
3. **Hallucination Examples**: Any assumptions you might have made incorrectly
4. **Improvement Suggestions**: How to make the COP framework more effective
5. **Critical Insights**: Key findings about the annotation system's value

## Additional Context

This is a stress test designed to challenge the COP framework with:
- Contradictory documentation (detailed docs, missing implementation)
- Security vulnerabilities that violate stated invariants
- Mix of partial, planned, and unimplemented features
- Human decision points and AI implementation opportunities

Your analysis will help determine the optimal annotation strategy for preventing AI hallucination while maintaining code clarity.
