IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide a direct, efficient response focused on the most essential information.
2. Prioritize answering all parts of the question concisely over exhaustive detail.
3. Do not ask for clarification or additional information.
4. For complex code tasks, focus on key patterns and principles rather than implementing every detail.
5. If the task seems too large, provide a high-level approach and the most critical implementation elements.
6. Limit explanations to core concepts - aim to complete your response within 60 seconds.
7. When code is requested, provide simplified implementations that demonstrate the approach.
8. For analytical tasks, focus on the most important insights rather than exhaustive analysis.

The following code contains bugs that need to be fixed. A user has reported the following issues:
- Sometimes valid operations fail unexpectedly
- There appear to be logical inconsistencies in the business rules
- Error handling is incomplete or incorrect

Please:
1. Identify all bugs, issues, and potential problems in the code
2. Explain the root cause of each issue
3. Provide fixed code with appropriate comments explaining your changes
4. Suggest improvements to prevent similar issues in the future

Be thorough in your analysis, as there may be multiple bugs of different types (logical errors, edge cases, etc.).
