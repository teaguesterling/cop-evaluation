IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide a direct, efficient response focused on the most essential information.
2. Prioritize answering all parts of the question concisely over exhaustive detail.
3. Do not ask for clarification or additional information.
4. For complex code tasks, focus on key patterns and principles rather than implementing every detail.
5. If the task seems too large, provide a high-level approach and the most critical implementation elements.
6. Limit explanations to core concepts - aim to complete your response within 60 seconds.
7. When code is requested, provide simplified implementations that demonstrate the approach.
8. For analytical tasks, focus on the most important insights rather than exhaustive analysis.

We need to implement a new feature in this system: user roles and permissions with different access levels.

Requirements:
- Support at least three role types: Admin, Manager, and User
- Each role should have different permission levels for operations
- Operations should check permissions before execution
- Support assigning multiple roles to a single user
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

Please:
1. Design the role and permission system
2. Show how to integrate it with the existing code
3. Implement all necessary new classes/methods
4. Modify existing code as needed to support permissions
5. Provide examples of how the new system would be used

Your implementation should follow the architectural patterns and style of the existing codebase.
