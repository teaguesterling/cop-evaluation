IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide a direct, efficient response focused on the most essential information.
2. Prioritize answering all parts of the question concisely over exhaustive detail.
3. Do not ask for clarification or additional information.
4. For complex code tasks, focus on key patterns and principles rather than implementing every detail.
5. If the task seems too large, provide a high-level approach and the most critical implementation elements.
6. Limit explanations to core concepts - aim to complete your response within 60 seconds.
7. When code is requested, provide simplified implementations that demonstrate the approach.
8. For analytical tasks, focus on the most important insights rather than exhaustive analysis.

We need to modify this code to add a new feature: partial refunds/cancellations. Please:

1. Explain how you would approach implementing this change
2. Identify existing functionality, constraints, or invariants that need to be respected
3. Outline potential challenges or edge cases to handle
4. Provide a detailed implementation of the necessary changes (new methods and modifications)
5. Suggest appropriate tests to verify your implementation

Your implementation should maintain the architectural style and guarantees of the existing code.
